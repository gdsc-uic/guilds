description:
  full: The UIC Volunteer Catechists is a service arm of the Campus Ministry whose primary function is to conduct catechesis to the community and to its members. Catechesis is the Church’s pastoral and missionary activity (CT18). Pope John Paul II describes Catechesis as “education in the faith... especially in the teaching of Christian doctrine imparted in an organic and systematic way with a view of initiating the hearers into the fullness of Christian life.” Organizing the UIC Volunteer Catechists is also part of the University’s response of the Church’s task for New Evangelization at the same time a response to the call of Pope Francis in his Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Gaudium “encouraging the Christian faithful to embark upon a new chapter of evangelization marked by the joy of the Gospel”.
