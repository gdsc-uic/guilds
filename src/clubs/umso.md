  full: UMSO is the official Muslim non-academic club of UIC, operated by Muslim students committed to representing and supporting the Muslim community within the university. The club aims to foster an environment where Muslim students can thrive academically and professionally while deepening their understanding of religion and practice of their faith. We emphasize the importance of deen (religion) and imaan (faith) in everyday life as we encourage members to grow spiritually alongside their academic pursuits. In addition to serving the Muslim student body, UMSO is an inclusive organization that welcomes students of all faiths and backgrounds. We believe in promoting brotherhood and sisterhood, where every member is valued and respected. Through our diverse range of activities, events, and programs, we strive to build a cohesive and supportive community that transcends religious boundaries where mutual respect, understanding, and collaboration among all students at UIC are given importance.

faqs:
  - question: What is Islam?
    answer: >
      Islam is a monotheistic religion founded on the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, who received revelations from God (Allah) documented in the Quran, the holy book of Islam. Central to Islam are the Five Pillars: Shahada (declaration of faith), Salah (prayer), Zakat (charitable giving), Sawm (fasting during Ramadan), and Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). These pillars guide Muslims in their faith and daily practices. Islam emphasizes living in accordance with Allah's will, promoting values such as compassion, justice, and humility, and providing comprehensive guidelines for personal, social, economic, and political life.
  - question: What is the difference between a Moro and a Muslim?
    answer: >
      The term "Moro" refers to a specific Muslim ethnic group native to the Philippines, primarily residing in the Mindanao region, Sulu Archipelago, and Palawan. While all Moros are Muslims, not all Muslims are Moros. This distinction lies in the ethnic and geographical context of the Moro people. Despite this, Moros share many similarities with the broader Muslim community, such as adherence to the Islamic faith and observance of its rituals and practices, including daily prayers, fasting during Ramadan, and following dietary laws. In essence, Moros are a subset of the global Muslim population, distinguished by their unique ethnic and regional identity within the Philippines.
  - question: Why do Muslim girls wear hijab (veil)?
    answer: >
      Muslim girls wear hijab (veil) primarily as a form of modesty, which reflects Islamic teachings that encourage both men and women to dress and behave modestly. The hijab (veil) symbolizes the belief that women in Islam are treated as gems, valued and respected for their character and faith rather than their physical appearance. Many Muslim girls express their devotion to Allah and embrace their identity, empowerment, and cultural heritage by wearing the hijab. The decision to wear the hijab is highly individual, influenced by personal convictions, family, and social contexts, and it varies among different individuals.
