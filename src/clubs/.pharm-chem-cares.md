Inevitable circumstances have put the PharmChem CARES into an unprecedented shift in terms of its service to society. Despite the changing paradigm, the organization believes in continuing the passion of uplifting others no matter the set-up, either virtual or face-to-face, together with the students who also continually seek to improve themselves into socially conscious, active, and responsible citizens of the nation.  

  
Through our branding, “Ad Nova Ratione”, which means towards new grounds, the PharmChem CARES is excited once again to extend its capability to make a change beyond the virtual world. As we once again dawn to transcend towards more face-to-face activities, we believe in continually surpassing the organization’s consistency and competence toward new and better grounds along with time.

With our deeper and richer color scheme, we are grounded in showing bolder and more confident actions through our activities in the Community, Academics, Religious, Environment, and Sociocultural areas that can make a significant impact to the people and of the student body. Hand in hand, let’s bring forth our society towards better and newer grounds.
#AdNovaRatione⚓
